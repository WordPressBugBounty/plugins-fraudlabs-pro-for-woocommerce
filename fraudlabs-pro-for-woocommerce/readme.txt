Fraud prevention plugin for WooCommerce to minimize payment fraud and avoid chargebacks. With the FraudLabs Pro Micro Plan, you can get 500 free fraud validation credits every month.

== Description ==

The Fraud Prevention Plugin is designed to help merchants detect and prevent fraud orders. It performs a comprehensive check on all elements (data points) within an order to accurately detect fraudulent patterns in a fraction of a second. The check includes geolocation, proxy, email, shipping address, credit card, transaction velocity, and more. The plugin also checks against our real-time blacklist data, contributed by our global merchant network, to gauge the fraud risk associated with the order. This plugin works well with all types of the payment method, and it's absolutely free for 500 orders validation per month or sales less than 25K USD per month.
